## Hey, I'm @g-parki
I often think *"there has to be a better way"*, and I love learning new tools to make that happen.
I'm interested in data science and data visualization.
I’m currently learning about neural networks and web apps for interactive plots and dashboards.

Languages I'm familiar with. Some more, some less:

- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- SQL
- VBA
- C++
